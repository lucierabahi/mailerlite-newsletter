### Demo:    
[Landing page for MailerLite weekly newsletter](https://lucierabahi.github.io/mailerlite-newsletter/)    

#### Comments 
1/ I asked myself the question of the advisability of the black background, and decided that it was fine: the rest of the design is close enough to the graphic charter so visitors and customers recognize MailerLite, but with variations that allow them to know that they are on a specific landing page and not the main website.
          
2/ I tried to work on the SEO and use keywords and links to MailerLite content, for Brand Authority reinforcement.
                     
3/ I thought it could be a good idea to offer an ebook when subscribing: MailerLite is asking something from the potential client (email address), but gives something at the same time. I think the person is more likely to subscribe if he/she feels he/she can benefit from the action and doesn't feel pressured to buy SaaS services immediatly. Moreover, you already have the content, you just need to make it an ebook ;-)
